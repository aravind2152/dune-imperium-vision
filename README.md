# 🐍🎲 Automating Dune Empire Board Game Gameplay with Python-Powered Computer Vision 🚀

Welcome to the "dune-imperium-vision" repository, where we bring the exciting world of the Dune Empire board game to life through the power of Python-powered computer vision! Our innovative system utilizes advanced image processing techniques to accurately identify and count player units—colored cubes—in conflict zones ⚔️ and garrisons 🛡️. Let's dive into the details of this fascinating project and how it can enhance your gaming experience!

### Project Overview
In this project, we leverage computer vision technologies such as canny edge detection, CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) method, Hough transform, HSV color detection, and other image processing algorithms to automate gameplay elements of the Dune Empire board game. By analyzing the game board through live or pre-captured images, our system can efficiently recognize and track player units, providing valuable insights and enhancing strategic decision-making.

### Key Features
🔍 Image Processing: Our system processes game board images to identify player units accurately.  
✨ Automated Unit Counting: Player unit counts in conflict zones and garrisons are automatically calculated.  
🎯 Enhanced Gameplay: Gain a competitive edge by leveraging our computer vision technology for strategic gameplay decisions.
